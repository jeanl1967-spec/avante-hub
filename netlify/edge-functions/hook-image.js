      // when it actually needs to. Any previously cached AI caption is
      // left in place here (not cleared) — hook-share-content.js compares

      // matches this new one, which it never will after this write.

      // before imageHash existed), so unlike before it runs unconditionally

      // rather than mutating and writing back the `record` read below,
      // which only exists to decide whether a gallery reset is needed and
      // which stale slots to delete; writing it back directly on every
      // single upload would risk clobbering a concurrent caption/booking
      // save to this same record far more often than the old,
      // gallery-reset-only write path ever could.
      //
      // Accepted, pre-existing-class limitation: this whole endpoint is
      // unauthenticated (same trust model as hook-pdf.js), so an upload to
      // any made-up aff/hook pair already creates a real image blob
      // regardless of this write — this hookStore record is small
      // incremental metadata on top of storage abuse that was already
      // possible before this feature existed, not a new attack surface of
      // its own, and every genuine upload needs its hash recorded here
      // for the AI-scan cache to work at all, so gating this write the
      // way DELETE's cleanup is gated below isn't an option without
      // breaking that for legitimate uploads too.
      // Known, accepted narrow race (not fixed — see reasoning below):
      // galleryCount here is read once, before the sha256Hex await, and
      // used to decide both which gallery slots to physically delete and
      // whether to merge galleryCount:0 afterward. mergeIntoRecord's own
      // re-read-before-write protects every *other* field from being
      // clobbered, but it can't retroactively validate a decision already
      // acted on using stale data — if admin-api.js's saveHookPhotos
      // (Auto-build) writes a fresh, different gallery for this exact
      // hook in the moment between this read and this branch's writes,
      // this upload could still delete Auto-build's newly-saved slot
      // blobs and reset its galleryCount back to 0. Fixing that fully
      // would need real per-hook locking around the delete+write pair,
      // not just a smarter merge — disproportionate for what this is: two
